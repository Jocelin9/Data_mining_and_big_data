        <p>Data mining is a vital tool for analyzing information that is hidden in large amounts of data.
          The data that is handled in mining can be both large and small, however, big data is more related 
          to the processes of bulky data processing.
          Data mining and big data use different procedures to manage the information they analyze, but they
          are complementary rather than antagonistic processes. Both aim to transform a huge amount of data 
          into relevant and useful information to serve the interests for which it has been decided to implement
          this technology, then we will know more information about each.

        </div>
        <p>Data mining is the exploration and analysis of data to discover patterns or rules that are meaningful.
          It is classified as a discipline within the field of data science.<br>
          Data mining techniques are for making Machine Learning (ML) models that enable artificial intelligence (AI) applications.<br>
          An example of data mining within artificial intelligence includes things like search engine algorithms and recommender systems.</p>

          <span class="question">The data mining process</span>
          <i class="bx bxs-chevron-down arrow"></i>
        </div>
        <p>There are four basic steps in the data mining process. (Problem definition, data collection and preparation, model building and model deployment).</p>
        <p><b>Definition of the problem:</b>
          The first step in any data mining project is to understand the goals and requirements. This should be specified from a business perspective and you should
          also have a basic implementation plan. If the business problem is to be able to sell more, the data mining problem will be 'what type of customer is likely 
          to buy the product?' Implementation begins with creating a model based on data such as past customer relationships and attributes, including demographics, 
          family size, age, residences, and more.</p>
        <p><b>Data collection and preparation:</b>
          The second phase covers data collection and exploration. An examination of the data collected will give you an idea of how accurate the fit is as a basis 
          for addressing your business problem. At this stage, one may decide to remove some data parameters or add some new ones. Here, data quality issues can be 
          addressed and scanned for possible patterns in the data.</p>
        <p><b>Construction and evaluation of models:</b>
          In step three, various modeling techniques are chosen and applied, and the parameters are calibrated to optimal levels. At this early stage of model building, 
          it is best to work with a smaller, well thought out data set. Re-evaluating at this point how the model addresses the business problem is a good idea. Any 
          form of improvement can be added at this stage.</p>
        <p><b>Deployment of models:</b>
          In the final stage of implementation, insights and actionable information can be derived from the data collected. This knowledge can be implemented within a 
          target environment. Implementation can include applying the model to any new data, extracting details from the model, integrating models into applications, and more.</p>

          <span class="question">Types of data mining</span>
          <i class="bx bxs-chevron-down arrow"></i>
        </div>
        <p>There are several types of data mining, including the following:</p>
        <p><b>Linear regressions:</b>
          With linear regression, a company can predict the values of a continuous variable with the help of one or more independent inputs. This method is often used 
          in the real estate business to predict home values based on variables such as square footage, year built, and ZIP code location.</p>
        <p><b>Logistic regressions:</b>
          In this variation, one or more independent inputs are used to predict the probability of a categorical variable. You'll see this used in banking systems 
          that use it to predict a loan applicant's chances of defaulting on loans based on their credit score, income, gender, age, and a host of other personal factors.</p>
        <p><b>Time series:</b>
          They are forecasting tools where the models make use of time as a fundamental independent variable. Retailers often make use of this model to be able to predict
          demand for products and work on their inventory accordingly.</p>  
        <p><b>Classification/regression trees.</b>
          Classification or regression trees are predictive modeling techniques in which the value of categorical and continuous target variables can be predicted. The model 
          creates binary rule sets based on this predicted data to classify and group the largest proportion of target variables that are similar under new observation heads. 
          With these rules, the new groups that are created become the predicted value of the new observations.</p>
        <p><b>Neural networks:</b>
          Neural networks are designed to work similar to how the brain works. Just as stimuli cause neurons in the brain to fire that enable action, neural networks use 
          inputs with a threshold requirement. These inputs will either "trigger" or "not trigger" your node depending on the magnitude. These activation or non-activation 
          signals are combined with other similar responses that may be hidden in the multiple layers of the network. The process continues to repeat until an output is created. 
          The benefit is near-instant output, and this technology is widely used in driverless cars for efficiency.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Big data is a data set so large and complex that none of the traditional data tools are capable of storing or processing it efficiently. Big Data consists of a process
         that analyzes and interprets large volumes of data, both structured and unstructured.</p>

          <i class="bx bxs-chevron-down arrow"></i>
        </div>
        <p>Big Data is used so that the data stored remotely can be used by companies as a basis for their decision making, the process that performs the analysis of large volumes 
          of data and extracted information helps, for example, to improve strategies and processes, to increase the competitive power of the company and to better understand consumers, 
          among many other applications.</p>

        <i class="bx bxs-chevron-down arrow"></i>
      </div>
      <p>There are 3 types, the structured, the unstructured and the semi-structured.</p>
      <p><b>Structured:</b> 
        Any data that can be stored, accessed, and processed in a fixed format is called "structured" data. During this period of time, IT talent has achieved better results 
        in developing techniques for working with this type of data (where the format is already known) and value has been derived.</p>
      <p><b>Unstructured:</b> 
        They are any data of unknown form or whose structure is classified as unstructured data. In addition to being enormous in size, unstructured data poses multiple challenges with 
        regards to processing it to derive value from it.</p>
      <p><b>Semi-structured:</b>  
        Semi-structured data can contain both types of data. They usually have a format that can be defined, but cannot be easily understood by the user and requires 
        the use of complex rules to help determine how to read each piece of information. An example of semi-structured data is data represented in an XML file.</p>

        <i class="bx bxs-chevron-down arrow"></i>
      </div>
      <p><b>Volume:</b> 
        Refers to the amount of data a company generates every second. These can come from various virtual sources, such as social networks, emails, electronic devices, etc.</p>
      <p><b>Velocity:</b>
         Velocity is the accelerated rate at which data is received and processed. Typically, the highest data rate flows directly into memory instead of being written to disk. 
        Some smart internet-enabled products operate in real time and will require real-time assessment and action.
      </p>
      <p><b>Variety:</b> 
        Variety refers to the different types of data that are available. Just as the variety concerns all the places where the data can be stored and extracted.
      </p>
      <p><b>Veracity:</b>
        Among the thousands of data that are processed, many may turn out to be false, so it is necessary to exclude them from the analysis. This process helps to "filter" what is 
        real from what is not.</p>
        <p><b>Worth:</b>
          The data that is collected is essential to extract value from it to help make the right decisions.</p>

        <div class="title" id="Conclusion"><h1>Conclusion</h1></div>
        <p>Through Big Data and Data mining analysis techniques, data of any nature can be exploited: databases, free text, numerical records,
          activity on social networks, audio, images, videos, etc. Even where there is a diversity of data and formats, they can be treated through 
          information integration strategies, thus enriching any solution. Data Mining requires Big Data to streamline its data processing and management
          and, at the same time, Big Data requires Data Mining for predictive data analysis and to be able to detect trends. We could say that there is a 
          mutual integration between technique and tool.
